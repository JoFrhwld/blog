For example, in the [aligned-textgrid package](https://forced-alignment-and-vowel-extraction.github.io/alignedTextGrid/), I started off by defining a class to represent intervals, which at their core have start and end times, and a label. Each interval also points to the interval objects preceding and following, as well as any intervals it contains or is contained in.\n\n## Doing it in R?\n\nI don't exactly *want* to replicate the entire package inside R, and for a while I wasn't even sure how I could, because of R's [copy-on-modify behavior](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/names-values.html#copy-on-modify).\n\nLet's say we had the following sequence of intervals:\n\n![](assets/intervals.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nWe could represent the basic information (start, end, and label) in lists. I'll also set up a reference to `interval_b` as following `interval_a`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninterval_a <- list(\n  start = 1,\n  end   = 2,\n  label = \"a\"\n)\n\ninterval_b <- list(\n  start = 3,\n  end   = 4,\n  label = \"b\"\n)\n\ninterval_a$fol <- interval_b\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can double check that the `fol` reference is working with `identical()` .\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nidentical(interval_a$fol, interval_b)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## `identical()`\n\n*This* took me a while to find. Python has a commonly used `is` operator for checking whether two variables refer to the same object, rather than just being equal.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\na = 1.0\nb = 2/2\n\na is b\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nFalse\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\na == b\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nTrue\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nBut I've never used R's `identical()` before, and it doesn't usually show up in intros to the language like python's `is`.\n:::\n\n### Copy-on-modify\n\nThings become a problem if we want to make changes to `interval_b`, though. One of the core tasks I wanted aligned-textgrid to make easy is the modification of interval labels. But in R, if we change the value of `interval_b$label`, that change *won't* be reflected in the values in `interval_a$fol`, and the reference between the two objects will be broken.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninterval_b$label <- \"new B\"\n\n# this is now false\nidentical(interval_a$fol, interval_b)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# this is the original label\ninterval_a$fol$label\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"b\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nTo understand what's going on here, I'd recommend checking out Hadley Wickham's [*Advanced R*](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) chapter on [Names and Values](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/names-values.html), especially the section on [Copy-on-modify](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/names-values.html#copy-on-modify).\n\n## OOP in R\n\nOne of these days, there's going to be a new R package called `yaoop` for Yet Another Object Oriented Paradigm. The class systems that ship with R are called `S3` and `S4`, and there are two new-ish class packages [R6](https://r6.r-lib.org/) and [S7](https://rconsortium.github.io/S7/). These two new packages both have pretty interesting properties, but as pointed out in [*Advanced R*](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/r6.html)\n\n> R6 objects are **mutable**, which means that they are modified in place, and hence have reference semantics.\n\nS7 is the newer package, but I've double checked, and it also follows copy-on-modify, which means R6 is the way to go for this kind of use case.\n\n### Trying out ![R6](assets/R6-logo.svg){height=\"1.2em\"}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(R6)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nFollowing the intro in the [R6 documentation](https://r6.r-lib.org/articles/Introduction.html), the most basic SequenceInterval class would be something like this.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSequenceInterval <- R6Class(\n  classname = \"SequenceInterval\",   # <1>\n  public = list(                    # <2>\n    start = numeric(0),             # <3>\n    end   = numeric(0),             # <3>\n    label = character(0),           # <3>\n    prev  = NULL,                   # <3>\n    fol   = NULL,                   # <3>\n                                    \n    initialize = function(          # <4>\n      start = numeric(0),           # <4>\n      end   = numeric(0),           # <4>\n      label = character(0)          # <4>\n    ){                              # <4>\n      self$start = start            # <4>\n      self$end   = end              # <4>\n      self$label = label            # <4>\n    }                               # <4>\n    \n  )                               \n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n1.  The name of the class you want to be returned when you use `class()` .\n2.  Any generally available class properties and methods are declared in a list passed to the `public` argument.\n3.  I believe a any properties you want to use or set through the rest of the class definition need to be declared here first.\n4.  `initialize` is a special method that's called when you use `SequenceInterval$new()`\n\nMy two sequence objects would then be:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninterval_a <- SequenceInterval$new(\n  start = 1,\n  end   = 2,\n  label = \"a\"\n)\n\ninterval_b <- SequenceInterval$new(\n  start = 2,\n  end   = 3,\n  label = \"b\"\n)\n\ninterval_a$fol <- interval_b\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nLet's double check that `sequence_b` is appropriately following `sequence_a`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nidentical(interval_a$fol, interval_b)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNow, for the moment of truth, we'll change the label on `interval_b` and see if it breaks things.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninterval_b$label <- \"new B\"\n\nidentical(interval_a$fol, interval_b)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninterval_a$fol$label\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"new B\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSuccess!\n\n## Getting more complicated\n\nI'm going to try to make things a little more complicated with respect to the`fol` and `prev` properties. I want\n\n-   When `fol` is set, `prev` is automatically set.\n\n-   When `prev` is set, `fol` is automatically set.\n\nThese aren't just nice quality of life features, but also capture the necessary logical properties of following and preceding.\n\nI think the way to go about this will be\n\n-   to lock off `fol` and `prev` from being directly settable. I think the best way to do this is to move them to [active bindings](https://r6.r-lib.org/articles/Introduction.html#active-bindings), which seems a lot like using the python `@property` decorator on a method.\n\n-   Add private `.fol` and `.prev` properties.\n\n-   Define setter functions that will update the `_fol` and `_prev` properties, being careful to avoid infinite recursion!\n\nI've described each new piece in the code annotations.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSequenceInterval <- R6Class(\n  classname = \"SequenceInterval\",\n  \n  private = list(                           # <1>\n    .fol = NULL,                            # <1>\n    .prev = NULL                            # <1>\n  ),                                        # <1>\n\n  active = list(                            # <2>\n    fol = function(){                       # <2>\n      return(private$.fol)                  # <2>\n    },                                      # <2>\n    prev = function(){                      # <2>\n      return(private$.prev)                 # <2>\n    }                                       # <2>\n  ),                                        # <2>\n\n  public = list(                            # <3>\n    start = numeric(0),                     # <3>\n    end   = numeric(0),                     # <3>\n    label = character(0),                   # <3>\n                                            # <3>\n    initialize = function(                  # <3>\n      start = numeric(0),                   # <3>\n      end   = numeric(0),                   # <3>\n      label = character(0)                  # <3>\n    ){                                      # <3>\n      self$start = start                    # <3>\n      self$end   = end                      # <3>\n      self$label = label                    # <3>\n    },                                      # <3>\n\n    set_fol = function(interval){           # <4>\n      private$.fol = interval               # <4>\n\n      if(identical(self$fol$prev, self)){   # <5>\n        return(invisible(self))             # <5>\n      }                                     # <5>\n\n      self$fol$set_prev(self)               # <6>\n\n    },\n\n    set_prev = function(interval){          # <7>\n      private$.prev = interval              # <7>\n                                            # <7>\n      if(identical(self$prev$fol, self)){   # <7>\n        return(invisible(self))             # <7>\n      }                                     # <7>\n                                            # <7>\n      self$prev$set_fol(self)               # <7>\n    }                                       # <7>\n\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n1.  Defining private properties. Convention in python is for the name of these properties to start with and underscore, but that's not allowed in R, so I'm going with dots.\n2.  These are the getter functions to return the actual `.fol` and `.prev` objects.\n3.  Same as the original class definition above.\n4.  This is the setter function for the following interval.\n5.  **SUPER IMPORTANT.** The `set_fol()` method is calling `set_prev()`, and the `set_prev()` method is calling `set_fol()`. To avoid infinite recursion, the function should stop here if it's *already* the preceding interval to its following interval.\n6.  A kind of interesting thing is I *have* to use the public `set_prev()` method here, because the method won't be able to dig into the private `.prev` property of `interval`.\n7.  Same logic as `set_fol()`.\n\nWe can still create intervals the same way as above.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninterval_a <- SequenceInterval$new(1, 2, \"a\")\ninterval_b <- SequenceInterval$new(1, 2, \"b\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nBut to set up `interval_b` as the interval following `interval_a`, you've got to use the `set_fol()` setter function.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninterval_a$set_fol(interval_b)\n\nidentical(interval_a$fol, interval_b)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nBut now, `interval_a` has been automatically set as preceding `interval_b`!\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nidentical(interval_b$prev, interval_a)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe major defect here is that if I, or a user, didn't know about the setter functions, we'll get a very inscrutable error message when trying to directly set `fol` or `prev`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninterval_a$fol <- interval_b\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in (function () : unused argument (base::quote(<environment>))\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nI might want to figure out if it's possible to get a better error here, or even better, some way to short circuit this assignment attempt to `set_fol()`, but I think that's a bit beyond my patience and time for right now.\n",
