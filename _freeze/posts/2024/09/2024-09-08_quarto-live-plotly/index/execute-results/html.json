My party has gotten to max level, and we're running around, casting spells and taking names.\n\nOne of the spells my wizard has is called *Disintegrate*, which gets summarized like this\n\n::: callout-important\n## Disintegrate\n\nShoot a thin green ray from your finger. If the spell reduces the target to 0 hit points, it disintegrates into a crumbly ash.\n\n### Damage\n\nðŸŽ² 10d6 + 40 (50\\~100)\n:::\n\nThe line of information under \"Damage\" means that to calculate how much damage you do when you cast the spell, you need to roll 10 6-sided dice (\"d6\"), then add 40. The \"(50\\~100)\" part summarizes the worst vs best outcomes.\n\nWorst\n\n:   You roll 10 d6, and they all come up [1]{.dice}.\n",
