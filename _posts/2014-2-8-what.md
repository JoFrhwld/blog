I'm considering blogging at my github domain.
Right now, my main github site is hosting my academic web page, so I've set up a repository called 'blog' to host the blog, so that it'll show up as jofrhwld.github.io/blog.
It seems like a pretty nice approach, and I wonder how many other use a github 'blog' repository in a similar way.

Thematically, I think I'll shift things that I feel are a bit too technical for <a href = "http://val-systems.blogspot.com/">Val Systems</a>, but I'll probably cross reference between here and there a lot.
