## About Me

I'm an Assistant Professor of Linguistics at the university of Kentucky. You can find out more about me and my research on [my homepage](https://jofrhwld.github.io/).

## About the title

In my variety of Philadelphia English, the diphthong /aw/ merges with /æː/ before /l/. So *vowel* and *val* both sound like \[væːɫ\], and sometimes *vow* gets into the mix as well.

Throughout grad school and a few years after, I maintained a blog called [Val Systems](http://val-systems.blogspot.com/). It's still there, but I got out of the habit of blogging there, and eventually came to feel a bit hampered by the drafting, posting & designing process there. So now, maybe I'll maintain **Væl Space.**
